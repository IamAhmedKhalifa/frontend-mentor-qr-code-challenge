## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. I have [deployed the final version here] (https://frontend-mentor-challenge-qr-code.netlify.app/).

I've been using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. You gotta start from somewhere I guess.
